Our new object oriented programming allows any user to add new types of 'Things'
without having to understand the implementation of plotter. You simply just Extend
the parent class "Thing" to fit the needs of the new type you want to make.
For ThingC, this was accomplished by extending ThingB and simply modifying
when and how the direction is changed. There is no need to understand how
plotter works. 

Given that Thing, ThingB, and ThingC are incredibly alike in terms of properties
and variables, functions are similar but slightly different. So many of the functions
are called the same name throughout. For example, there is a different maybeTurn
function for Thing, ThingB, and ThingC. But Polymorphism allows us to 
call each function given different arguements, and we do not need to worry
about the wrong function being called. At the end of the day, ThingC and ThingB
are both 'Thing' objects. A thing is a thing is a thing...
